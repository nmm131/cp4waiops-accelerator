# Prepare for Slack Reset


### Get the User OAUTH Token

This is needed for the reset scripts in order to empty/reset the Slack channels.

This is based on [Slack Cleaner2](https://github.com/sgratzl/slack_cleaner2).
You might have to install this:

```bash
pip3 install slack-cleaner2
```

In your Slack app

1. In the `OAuth & Permissions` get the `User OAuth Token` (not the Bot User OAuth Token this time!) and jot it down
2. Modify the file `00_config-secrets.sh` and replace `not_configured` with the token
